                SUMMARY:
                Retail investors have stayed committed to Indian markets through multiple crises, but their confidence must be continually reinforced as savings grow. Taxation, especially STT, CTT, and capital gains, adds friction and makes India less competitive globally. Predictable, rational tax policy and long-term support for mutual funds are crucial to sustain domestic capital formation. Higher capex, especially in defence and infrastructure, is essential for long-term growth.

                SUMMARY:
                Historical data from the past 15 years shows that pre-Budget corrections in the Sensex and Nifty often set the stage for post-Budget rebounds. Large-cap indices recover quickly, while midcaps and smallcaps show gradual gains. Budget 2026 is expected to focus on fiscal prudence, infrastructure, MSMEs, and growth support amid global headwinds.

                SUMMARY:
                Market expert Sudip Bandyopadhyay suggests Budget 2026 can stabilize equity sentiment by addressing FPI concerns, particularly through the removal of long-term capital gains tax. A clear divestment strategy and targeted sectoral support in banking, BFSI, defence, and infrastructure are also highlighted as crucial for boosting market confidence and encouraging foreign investment amid global uncertainties.

                SUMMARY:
                After U.S. forces snatched Nicolas Maduro in a daring night raid earlier this month, President Donald Trump began pressing oil companies to invest in Venezuela’s heavily corroded petroleum industry. The U.S. president eagerly urged drillers to invest in Venezuela, which sits atop the world’s largest oil reserves, with Washington’s protection. But those overtures received a lukewarm reception from U.S. and European energy companies. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods called Venezuela uninvestable provoking Trump’s ire, but some…

                Eager to counter a spreading perception of unreliability due to financial woes, Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, is trying to double down on its construction promises to build up Uzbekistan’s nuclear energy capacity. Instead of just building reactors, Rosatom is now proposing to create a “nuclear cluster” in Uzbekistan. Rosatom boss Alexei Likhachev reportedly made the offer during a tête-à-tête with Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on January 27 in Tashkent. The proposed cluster “would…

# ☁️ How to get a Free Cloud Server (VPS)
For a trading bot to run 24/7 without your laptop, you need a **Virtual Private Server (VPS)**.
Here are the only 3 methods to get this potentially for free.

## 1. Oracle Cloud "Always Free" (🏆 BEST OPTION)
Oracle offers the most generous free tier in the industry. It is powerful enough to run this bot easily.
*   **Specs**: 4 ARM CPU Cores, 24GB RAM (Massive power).
*   **Cost**: $0.00 / Forever.
*   **Requirements**: A Credit Card for identity verification (they charge ~$1 and refund it).
*   **Pros**: Real, powerful server. Won't shut down.
*   **Cons**: Signup can be picky about cards/regions.

## 2. AWS Free Tier (12 Months)
Amazon Web Services (AWS) gives you a small server (`t2.micro` or `t3.micro`) free for the first year.
*   **Specs**: 1 CPU, 1GB RAM (Weak, but works for basic bot).
*   **Cost**: Free for 12 months, then ~ $10/mo.
*   **Requirements**: Credit Card.
*   **Pros**: Industry standard, very reliable.
*   **Cons**: Only free for 1 year. Low RAM (Swap memory needed).

## 3. Google Cloud "Always Free" (US Only)
GCP offers an `e2-micro` instance for free in specific US regions (us-west1, us-central1).
*   **Specs**: 2 vCPUs, 1GB RAM.
*   **Cost**: $0.00 / Forever (if within limits).
*   **Requirements**: Credit Card.
*   **Pros**: Google infrastructure.
*   **Cons**: Server location must be US (Higher latency for Indian markets ~200ms).

### My Recommendation
**Try Oracle Cloud first.** If you can pass their verification, you get a beast of a machine for free that can run this bot + 10 others.

### Can I set this up for you?
I cannot create the account (it requires your card/identity).
**But once you have the server (IP address, Username, Password)**, I can walk you through the commands to install the bot there.

### Immediate Alternative
Until then, the **"Old Laptop" strategy**.
Use an old, spare laptop. Put it in a corner, plug it in, set "Sleep" to "Never". It is free and you own it.
